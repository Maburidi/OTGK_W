Find the Colab tutorial in the tutorial folder to run this repository and to predict small molecule structure-activity releationship. <br /> 
All data used are in the 'data' folder, its obtained from  [Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets))


Make sure to install the following dependincies:  

```
pip install POT
